# PEOCS Final Project of Group 3
This project serves as the final project of the course PEOCS-2023. We implement the PPO algorithm on the Pong game in the gym environment. The realization of the PPO algorithm follows the fashion of cleanRL. This is, however, the very vanilla version of PPO, based on which we try to make some innovations.
